        <h2>My Interests & Hobbies</h2>
        <p>Beyond coding and computer science, I have many interests that keep me happy and motivated. Here are some of the things I like doing when I'm not on campus.</p>

            <h3>Gaming</h3>
            <img src="images/gaming.jpeg" alt="Gaming Images" width="500">
            <p>I'm somewhat of a gamer and enjoy both competitive and RPG games. Gaming is the main reason I wanted to learn programming, since I wanted to understand how games are built, and maybe create one of my own one day.</p>

            <h3>Favorite Games</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Roblox&mdash;Forsaken - Love working together with teamates</li>
                <li>Undertale/Deltarune - RPG games made by Toby Fox about choices</li>
                <li>Sonic The Hedgehog series - Fast gameplay</li>
                <li>Mario Party Series - Luck based virtual board game</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p><strong>What I Love About Gaming:</strong> Problem-solving, quick reaction time, teamwork, and behind-the-scenes mechanics or secret content.</p>

            <h3>Techonology & Gadgets</h3>
            <img src="images/insidepc.jpeg" alt="Inside of a Computer" width="500">
            <p>I am astonished by new(er) technology and love learning about how and why they were created. Their reviews on YouTube go into detail, and I like watching about them.</p>
            <h3>Tech Interests</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Creating and customizing PCs</li>
                <li>Learning about Artificial Intelligence and their purpose</li>
                <li>Exploring new applications and software</li>
                <li>Samples and teasers about how new techonolgy can be used</li>
            </ul>
        </article>

            <h3>Sports and Fitness</h3>
            <img src="images/soccer.jpeg" alt="HS Soccer Game" width="500">
            <p>Staying active is not necessarily what I do in my spare time, but if it's right in front of me, I might take the oppurtunity to try it. Sports teach me teamwork, strategy, and thinking, skills that are very important to coding and problem-solving.</p>
            <h3>Activities I Enjoy</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Playing Soccer</li>
                <li>Running on Treadmills</li>
                <li>Watching Soccer games</li>
                <li>Watching Football games</li>
            </ul>
        </article>

            <h3>How my Interests Connect to CS</h3>
            <p>All of these interests can connect back to my computer science program in many ways. Gaming was the reason I wanted to program in the first place, technology keeps me wanting to improve, and sports teaches me teamwork and strategy, which are all things  I need to get better and learn. I believe these interests can help me a lot with computer science, making me a better programmer, and making me a better problem solver.</p>
