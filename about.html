            <h3>My Background</h3>
            <p>As you already know, I am a freshman at BCTS. Being enrolled in Computer Science was a choice from myself and myself only. I chose this program because I've always been interested in techonolgy, computers, hardware, and how all of them work. I also like creating things that people use for their benefit.</p>
            <p>Outside of school, I enjoy playing video games, learning about new coding languages, and working on coding skills. I'm glad to use these skills during high school and possibly get a job in techonology.<p>
